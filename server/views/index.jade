        h2 Beautiful Music Collections
        p
          | We understand that your music library is not a spreadsheet, but a treasured collection that should remind you of digging through the crates at a record store. In Ohm, each of your artists gets a unique profile page, allowing you to easily browse through and showcase your favorite artist collections.
        h2 Playlists Done Right
        p
          | We were annoyed by the fact that players were repositories for your playlists, rather than a factory of them. To solve this problem we introduced a queue, which allows you to quickly build on-the-go playlists. Once created, your can then associate your own photos with these playlists, creating a far more personal musical experience.
        h2 Share Musical Moments
        p
          | We\'ve enabled you to share the current song you\'re listening to from your music player to your preferred social network with a single click. You can also attach links from your preferred web services like YouTube so other friends can listen in too.
        h2 Sleek Controls
        p
          | While the original iPod was designed with a click wheel, the current generation of smartphones requires little more than your finger to operate. Ohm has a full suite of gesture controls so you can use seamlessly play and pause, jump forward or back within your current shuffle or queue, ideal for when you\'re on a run, at the gym, or just walking around town.
