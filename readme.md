## [nodejs boilerplate]

This is a very simple Node.js Boilerplate that uses Express, Jade, Stylus, Nib and Coffeescript. It does absolutely nothing, but provides a good structure for your app as well as configured middleware so that you can immediately get to work with your app.

* Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.
